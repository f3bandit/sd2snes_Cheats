# With the codes disabled, go to the
# &#039;Hangar&#039; room, and in the Arms menu,
# put the cursor on Equip. Enable the
# codes, enter the menu, then disable the
# codes. You can screw up the rest
# of the game if you don&#039;t do
# this exactly as stated. You can save
# the effects after the codes are disabled.
# This lets you avoid using the &#039;Analyze&#039;
# option in the lab on any enemy
# parts, because you&#039;ll have all of the
# effects of analyzing them

# You get nothing for beating them, and

# give you stuff you could need from
# the enemies. With the &#039;Enable Everything&#039; code,
# you don&#039;t need to get any Neoparts.
# This makes it so you can breeze
# through the game without losing out on
# new equipment because of a lack of
# neoparts. Tested it through a game
