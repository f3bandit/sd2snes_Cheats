# By ????? - Chest in elder&#039;s basement
# doesn&#039;t go away), F36B-8D18 (Chest in elder&#039;s
# basement gives you the Gigas Sword [by
# jesses@jeffnet.org]) 2.  Play until the part
# where you get the chest in elder&#039;s
# basement.  Get the chest (Gigas Sword),
# save at the Inn and reset the
# game. 3.  Erase F36B-8D18 and enter
# this code:  F96B-8718 (Chest in elders
# basement gives you the Flammie Drum -
# by ?????).  Get the Flammie Drum.
#  Save at inn. Reset game. 4.
#  Enter the code: 6DAA-776D (by XDAVE69).
#  Fly Flammie to Pandora.  Get
# Girl to join.  Now fly to
# the Lofty Mnts., and strike an enemy.
#  The game will appear to freeze.
#  Turn off FX switch after about
# 30 secs.  and you will be
# at Level 99.  This will make
# the game a lot easier.  You
# will also find that you have a
# lot of GP (something like 8,000,000). 
# Fly to gold city and purchase 3
# Battle Suits, 3 Lazuri Rings, 1 Dragon
# Helm and 2 Duck Helms. This will
# make your journey much easier. 5. 
# Erase 6DAA-776D, fly to the Water Palace,
# then to Gaia&#039;s Navel and play the
# game normally (except until you go thru
# the Witch&#039;s castle.  After beating Spiky
# Tiger, now that you have all 3
# people in your party, fly to the
# ruins near Northtown.  Go through the
# ruins until you find the room with
# a chest with Sword Orbs (it&#039;s on
# one of the lower levels, a door
# guarded by spikes.  You must hit
# a switch to eliminate the spikes. 
# Get the chest twice (since you only
# have 2 orbs, and this chest is
# one of those that will &quot;boost&quot; you
# up to 6 orbs, you can get
# up to four).  6.  Fly
# to one of Watts&#039; locations, and use
# two Sword Orbs if you still have
# the Gigas Sword, or one orb if
# you have the Dragon Buster.  You
# will now get the MANA SWORD, which
# strikes for 250+ HP on a normal
# hit, and 500+ on a critical! 
# However, you can only charge the Sword
# to level 3.  DON&#039;T FORGE THE
# SWORD ANY MORE!!!! TO ENABLE CHARGING TO
# LEVEL 8: - Go thru the rest
# of the game (but DON&#039;T TRY AND
# FORGE THE SWORD ANYMORE!) until you finish
# the Pure Land. - Find out how
# many sword orbs you have and how
# many are used by going to the
# Weapon/Magic skill screen. (It will probably say
# 3/8 which means you have 8 and
# used 3. - Go to Watts and
# use all but two of your Sword
# Orbs (three if you had 3/8), so
# the Sword Orb total is now 6/8,
# but your sword will be a copy
# of another weapon (e.g. whip or glove)!
# - Enter the codes F36B-8D18 and AC26-8738,
# sneak into Potos (go up to the
# guy blocking your path, hold up and
# press SELECT repeatedly), and get the chest
# in Elder&#039;s basement.  The &quot;clone weapon&quot;
# will become the Gigas Sword.  
# - Fly to Watts&#039; and use the
# 2 remaining Sword Orbs.  The Gigas
# Sword will become the Mana Sword and
# be chargable to Level 8!!! NOTE: 
# DO NOT CAST DRYAD&#039;S &quot;MANA MAGIC&quot; WHILE
# EQUIPPED WITH MANA SWORD OR IT WILL
# CHANGE INTO THE SPIKE KNUCKLE!!!  JUST
# FIGHT WITH THE MANA BEAST WITH THE
# SWORD...YOU DON&#039;T NEED TO CAST MANA MAGIC.
