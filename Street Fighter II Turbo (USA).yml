# The correct behavior of the Light Psycho
# Crusher when it is blocked in all
# versions of Street Fighter II is for
# it to chip twice, except when it
# is blocked from really far away. Because
# it only chips once in Turbo Mode,
# the Light Psycho Crusher leaves you in
# a completely defenseless position if your opponent
# blocks it. The Light Psycho Crusher in
# Turbo Mode contains an additional 4 animation
# frames compared to the Champion Edition Light
# Psycho Crusher. These 4 additional frames are
# what causes it not to chip correctly
# when it is blocked. This code essentially
# removes those 4 extra frames so that
# it behaves properly on block. Looking at
# the code of the game, this seems
# to have been a mistake on the
# part of Capcom that never got caught.
# I doubt they intentionally put those 4
# extra frames there. A shortcut way to
# fix this problem, is to simply give
# Turbo M. Bison his Champion Edition Psycho
# Crusher. His Psycho Crusher in Champion Edition
# has a smaller vulnerability box at his
# mid-section, but otherwise functions the same as
# the Turbo Psycho Crusher, excluding the bug
# with the Light version. So you can
# use this code below as a replacement
# for the lengthy Bug Fix code: DD54-EF05	Turbo
# M. Bison has Champion Edition M. Bison's
# (better) Psycho Crusher
