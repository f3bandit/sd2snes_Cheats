# Did you know there&#039;s a debug menu
# in earthbound and you can only access
# it thru the Multi-task GG code? You
# can only access it at three places
# using the code: inside Dungeon Man, Scaraba
# Bazaar, and The Place before the final
# battle. For information there&#039;s a FAQ about
# it located here: http://starmen.net/mother2/tips/Debug05.htm  Of course
# there&#039;s another way to get to it
# too. .I was searching around the starmen.net
# forums and found out that someone found
# a better debug menu with a kirby
# sprite on it. A guy hacked a
# code to access it but the only
# problem is you could only access it
# when you first started up the game
# (after you resetted the game on a
# emulator) and you couldn&#039;t use it during
# the game. (You can find the code
# for it and a picture here: http://forum.starmen.net/ultimatebb...=8;t=000350;p=1)
#  I decided to mess around with
# it and I found the code you
# see before you! This code above lets
# you enter the debug mode screen with
# kirby right after you load a save
# game. When you exit the debug mode
# screen thru some of the options, you&#039;ll
# still be warped to Tenda Village, but
# the options aren&#039;t pink anymore. You can
# leave the Village thru the doors now,
# and you can access the debug options
# as much as you like now without
# the game freezing on you.
