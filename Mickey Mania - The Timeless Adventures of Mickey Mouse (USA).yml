# After warping back to a previous stage,
# pause will be disabled. Appears to be
# a cutscene and/or pause menu combined. The
# level warp location seems to be set
# where an enemy and/or object moves from
# left or right. Wherever they stop while
# moving in a specific direction is where
# to stand. Then you will have to
# jump on the enemy or object and
# land in the opposite direction in that
# spot. (Might be untrue). I forgot to
# notify that the &quot;Stage Level Warp Menu
# Loader &quot; code and its values is
# for reference. Those are the default values
# for when the menu is not active.
