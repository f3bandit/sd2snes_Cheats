# I combined all of the 'Have Katanas',
# 'Have Bo', and 'Have Sai' and 'Have
# Nunchuks' codes that can be found on
# the web. Want to have two players
# as the same character? For example, P1
# should choose a different turtle at the
# select screen (Leonardo), and keep Michelangelo in
# his/her character modifier. Player two should choose
# whatever character player one placed into his/her
# character modifier. Once you are in the
# game, P2 won't be there. Change P1's
# character modifier to anyone other than what
# it was before. Suddenly, player two should
# join in as the same character player
# 1 started out as! A bit inconvenient,
# but it works. Also, although P2 may
# have the same colour as P1, they
# still retain their original weapon. 02 -
