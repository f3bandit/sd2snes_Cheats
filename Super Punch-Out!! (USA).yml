# then see a screen as if you
# were fighting Gabby Jay, only it says
# "Champ." next to his name! Turn the
# code off, and during the fight, turn

# the status screen comes up on top
# of your fight (all of the junk
# you get after winning a fight), but
# you are still in the fight. Contact
# me if anyone finds any usefullness to
# this code.
