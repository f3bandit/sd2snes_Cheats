# Note: The stages don&#039;t display or behave
# correctly when you first use this. To
# fix this, use the instantly die code
# to kill your character about 1 or
# 2 times. For the Time Machine Stages,
# don&#039;t try to jump to them while
# playing another stage, because you&#039;ll either skip
# them entirely, or crash the game. For
# them, start a new game, and make
# sure the infinite fuel code is off.
# When you get past the prologue and
# press start screen, you&#039;ll instantly die, but
# you&#039;ll then be able to play the
# stage normally.
