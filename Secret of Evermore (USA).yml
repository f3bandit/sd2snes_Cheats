# dog give the enemies 999 damage (no
# meter charge required or reached 100%) and
# dodge enemies 99%.  Now, put the
# dog aggression level on high and attack
# power to 0 for 999 damage. 
# Sorry to those who&#039;s dog is not
# level 99.  Change slot 1 and
# 2 (probably only slot 2) for your
# game depend on the dog&#039;s level. 
# Make sure that the Hit% does not
# exceed 99% or the dog will miss
# the attack.  Note: After the dog
# raised a level, the stats (HP, Level,
# Attack...etc.) will change to accomendate it (level
# thing) and the dog will missed all
# of the attacks if the Hit% is
# more than 99%.  You should raise
# the dog to level 99 first before
# using this code. This way the dog
# stats remain the same throughout the game.
