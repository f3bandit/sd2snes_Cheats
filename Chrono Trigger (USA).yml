# GG code: EEB4-546B
# This code is very weird.  Turn
# on the GG when it starts saying
# &quot;Crono...&quot;  Then go down and talk
# to Crono&#039;s Mom. She will give you
# the chance to name Lucca but you
# will only get a black screen instead
# of the name screen.  Press start
# to go on from this point. 
# Then go straight upstairs and go back
# down.  You have about a 50/50
# chance of seeing Crono&#039;s Mom sitting in
# her chair.  If she is, then
# when you come up to her she
# will say something like &quot;Crono, I heard
# you were going to be executed.&quot; This
# means you skipped ahead into the game.
#  The save menu name is now
# &#039;forward to the past&#039;.  You only
# have Crono, but the events are the
# same as if you had gone through
# the game to that point except the
# men are still guarding Lucca&#039;s machine. 
# It certainly is weird and there are
# many glitches, but it might be modified.
# Also if you keep it on, you
# may see the bad ending in a
# building in Truce.

# GG code: EE68-7D0C
# This code has two effects.  The
# first is this: go into a shop
# (things should Have different prices), exit it,
# go back in, and voila!  Everything
# Will cost only 1GP, and you will
# be able to sell ANY item in
# your inventory; allowing you to rid yourself
# of old accessories, armor, etc.  But
# you won&#039;t get anything for the things
# you sell.  The second effect is
# this: simply go to the stat screen,
# and any character will be able to
# equip anything.  Ex: equip Robo with
# a Rainbow, Crono with a Prism Dress,
# etc. This doesn&#039;t mean you can equip,
# say, Weapons in your armor slot, it
# means you can equip any Weapon in
# your Weapon slots, etc.  Note: There
# are two bad sides to this code,
# the first is thAt you can&#039;t use
# items, and the second is that it
# causes graphic glitches while walking on the
# map. So, only use the effects of
# this code when needed.

# 1. Take your dec number (like 99999

# it to hex (01869F)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;

# Reverse the order of the numbers (9F
# - 86 - 01)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;  
#   4. Apply the hex numbers
