# After the mission starts, turn on this
# cheat. All it does is set all
# the moves to Psylocke&#039;s moves. If you
# choose Cyclops using the first three cheats
# (immediately above this one), you&#039;ll be able
# to blast everything with rapid-glitchy-eye-lasers until you
# turn on the fourth cheat. She uses
# the colors of whoever you chose to
# start the mission, but it&#039;s possible to
# override that with cheats. Here are the
# values, starting from 7E0400. Since this is
# an insane number of cheats to create,
# (32, to be exact) you&#039;re better off
# using a hex editor to copy in
# these values, starting at 0x1013 of any
# ZST/ZSX file for a temporary fix. 0C32BD42162E7119CD04836A045A844D033DE030566D1D57ED500A4020381900
# You can turn these on anytime. Walking
# behind things (like the tree at the
# start of stage 2) seems to make
# the game update our new palette from
# the cheats.
