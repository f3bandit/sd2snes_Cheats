# The base effect that all of these
# codes share is that once you charge
# and fire a certain level, you never
# go below that level. This means you
# will eventually lose the ability to charge.
# None of these codes take effect until
# you fire a charged shot. Many will
# stop working when and for as long
# as you hold the fire button, Y.
# All code definitions assume that Y is
# the fire button. DD	Only the basic effect.
# DF	Warp to point of origin (if you
# are in the boss room, you return
# to the top    
#     left corner). 	
# 	Hold Y to walk normally. Note that
# when you warp, your velocity will be
# &quot;remembered&quot;, and when you stop warping, you
# will keep going in that direction. 
#       
# Turning off effects has the same effect
# as holding Y. D4	Can&#039;t move. Hold Y
# to move. D7	Get stuck in movements. Means:
# walk kinda slow, jump slow (but glide
# GREAT!), 	run/dash as long as you please,
# get stuck on walls and wall-jump in
# mid-air.      
#   Hold Y to move normally,
# and tap Y to jump up walls
# (note that you keep   
#      jumping, even
# after you clear the wall!). D0	Walk right
# a little slower, and left a little
# faster. Hold Y to walk normally. D9	Snap
# to the nearest waypoint. Waypoints are at
# the leftmost edge of each screen 
#       
# (like if the level didn&#039;t scroll horizontally).
# Press left to snap to the 
#       
# previous waypoint. Hold Y to walk normally.
# D1	Fly back left a LONG way (after
# passing the scrolling point). Hold Y to
# walk      
#   normally. D5	Jump a tiny bit
# higher. Hold Y to jump the normal
# height. D6	Hover on the top of the
# screen. Getting hit may send you flying
# above the top    
#     of the screen.
# Hold Y to drop down. Note that
# you really can&#039;t shoot at things 
#       
# with this code. DB	Bounce on the top
# of the screen. Otherwise is the same
# as the previous code. D3	Character becomes INVISIBLE!
# Note that you can NOT hold Y
# to make him visible! 	May become visible
# when you get hit and flash, but
# goes back invisible    
#     afterwards. DE	Different new
# animations (#1). Hold Y for normalcy. FF	COMPLETELY
# invisible!!! Means: character, charge ring surrounding character,
#       
#  shots, even explosions! Can&#039;t use Y
# to make him visible... F7	Different new animations
# (#2). Hold Y for normal animations. F0	Odd
# animation (#3) of character on his butt.
# Even when standing still! Hold Y 
#       
# to be normal. F9	Different new animations (#4).
# Again, use Y... F5	Very odd, shattered looking
# animations (#5). Yes, Y... FC	Jump to the
# right slower, and to the left faster.
# Hold Y for normal speed. F8	Jump in
# both directions slowly. Hold Y for normal
# speed. FA	Personal gravity is very high. Means:
# jump very low, fall very fast. Hold
# Y for     
#    normal gravity. F2	Slow flying
# code. Press jump button (B) to get
# off the ground. From there, will 
#       
# slowly levitate on your own. Press left
# and right to move laterally. Press Y
#       
#  repeatedly to hover, and hold Y
# to drop. F3	Jump up extremely high, and
# drop very slowly (almost the opposite of
# the flying     
#    code). Hold Y to
# drop fast or to jump normally. 4D	Fall
# through the floor (not entirely). May get
# stuck on floor supports. Hold Y 
#       
# and jump to get out of the
# floor. 4F	Fall through the floor (less than
# the previous code) Jumping and pressing left
#       
#  or right will send you zooming
# in that direction. May not take collision
# damage      
#   from enemies. May be hurt
# by certain floor sections. Hold Y and
# jump to get up. 45	Become exhausted. Can&#039;t
# do anything. Turning off effects has no
# effect. Holding     
#    Y has no effect.
# May well be a freeze code in
# disguise... 7D	Don&#039;t become invincible after being hit.
# Can take MEGA damage from landing on
#       
#  an enemy (spike wheels can kill
# instantly!). Hold Y to get invincible from
#       
#  being hit, like normal. 71	Can&#039;t run/dash
# very much (MAYBE a couple of centimeters).
# Hold Y to run. 75	Can ONLY run.
# Hold Y to move normally. 7C	Can&#039;t run
# at all. Hold Y to run. 78	Can&#039;t
# jump or pause. Hold Y to jump
# or pause. 03	Land on your feet oddly.
# Walk from a dead standing start oddly
# (and slowly).     
#    Hold Y to walk
# normally. 0E	Split second delay when turning rapidly.
# Means: press left and right wildly to
#       
#  make him twirl like a ballerina.
# Hold Y to stop the effect. 9D	Delay
# between shooting action and shooting animation. Obviously
# can&#039;t use Y to   
#      stop. 95	Can&#039;t
# charge (above what he&#039;s stuck at). Obviously
# can&#039;t use Y to stop. 96	This MUST
# be the default ROM value for this
# code... Even dud codes still have 
#       
# the basic effect, and crash codes crash
# the game. This does NOTHING!!!! 9B	Can&#039;t fire
# charged shots (after the code is activated).
# Obviously can&#039;t use Y   
#      to stop.
# 92	Jump in both directions VERY slowly. Hold
# Y for normal speed. 93	Can&#039;t jump. Hold
# Y to jump. 1D	Fast flying code. Jump
# normal height. At peak of jump, begin
# to float upwards    
#     (faster than in
# slow flying code). Otherwise same as slow
# flying code. 1B	Fire all charged shots to
# the left. After walking in either direction,
# face      
#   left. Tap right and go
# left. Hold Y to walk (but not
# shoot) normally. 1E	Arm stays out, as if
# shooting. Will not work after shooting, and
# before moving.     
#    Hold Y to stop
# effect. . .	GREAT ABYSMAL LACK OF CODES
# .      
#     EE	Charge ring surronding
# character grinds to a halt. Can not
# use Y to stop.   
#       
# This list does not include: dud codes,
# crash codes, duplicate effects. Other effects may
# be possible from B6-E2; I was SICK
# AND TIRED because there are 256 possibilities,
# and also because of the aforementioned GREAT
# ABYSMAL LACK OF CODES within that range.
