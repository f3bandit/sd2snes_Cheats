# This&#039;ll cause your first city to build
# anything in 1 turn. Remember, it&#039;s not
# a good idea to have 1 city
# supporting a huge amount of units without
# growing with time to allow itself to
# support them...so this code&#039;s best for buildings
# and such. I always build all the
# Wonders with this, heh.   
# Again, I&#039;m too lazy to hack for
# the other cities, as it&#039;s not really
# integral. Request if it&#039;s that important to
# you.
