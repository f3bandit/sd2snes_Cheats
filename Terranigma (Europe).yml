# The codes can be used with a
# saved game but you must enter the
# code BEFORE you reach that  level.
#  For instance: If you use a
# code for level 3, you must enter
# the code before you reach level 3.
# If the codes don&#039;t work from a
# saved game, then you will have To
# enter them at the start of a
# new game. You can use as many
# of these codes together (at the same
# time) as you want. You can change
# the amount of HP (or whatever) in
# the codes just by changing the first
# 2 digits of the code.
