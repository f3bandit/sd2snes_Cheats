# This works up around when you first
# talk to Lucifer, and shortly after Gabriel
# grabs you in the Abyss, where your
# alignment is permanantly changed to Law, Neutral,
# or Chaos. This code should allow you
# to pick any of those paths, though,
# and equip whatever armor you want to
# by temporarily changing the 80 to 00
# or FF. Note that after you talk
# to the Law guardian you named, your
# alignment may automatically be permanantly set to
# Law, if you&#039;re that far to the
# Law side. Otherwise, with this code on,
# you get a choice
