# This code has severe problems, try not
# to use it if you can avoid
# it. If you do buy stuff, save
# the game quick, all items cost 100
# gold. Code can easily erase your saved
# game. Code use can differ, first try
# it and turn on effect switch right
# when you enter a shop, if that
# doesn&#039;t work, just have the effect switch
# on when you start the game. NOTE:
# All items will cost 100 gold and
# appear to have the same name, they
# all cost 100 gold but they are
# different, they are the same as what
# the shop normally sells.

# Hitting certain squares (the good ones) is

# use this code start game with effect
# switch off, once you enter the bingo
# place and hit play, the bingo game
# will start, only when the bingo game
# starts up, then you can turn on
# the effect switch, turn off the effect
# swith when you are done at the
# bingo place, then go and save your
# game. When you hit the pick 3
# squares square, you will be able to
# pick three squares, but when you try
# to, it doesn&#039;t seem to let you
# go down from the first level. JUST
# HIT UP ON THE CONTROL PAD, IT
# WILL PUT YOU AT THE BOTTOM LEVEL,
# YOU&#039;LL THEN HAVE ACCESS TO THE REST
# OF THE NUMBER SQUARES.] (Also there are
# a few slight problems with the graphics,
# some of the boxed information goes invisible,
# when the code is enter, but they
# aren&#039;t of any real trouble.) You can
# use this code to get tons of
# money, win a lot of the bubble
# gum at one of the bingo places
# and sell it for 3500 gold each.
# You will need about 5000 gold before
# they let you enter the good bingo
# place, so just go to the bad
# one, win some stuff and sell it
# quick.

# This is an EXTREMELY difficult code to

# as a item shots out some kind
# of magic attack. Go to the inn,
# next save it ( the game), meet
# one of the people at the inn,
# if no ones around go to another
# inn, attack the person, turn on the
# effect switch when you press the attack
# command, turn it off immediately atfer the
# attack begins. The person along with one
# to two new enemies appears, kill the
# new enemies first, the new enemies have
# a messed up graphic so it&#039;s not
# hard to figure out who they are,
# killing the new enemines can only be
# done with magic, you&#039;ll get after killing
# all of them, 40000 exp and some
# gold. Next go out of the inn
# and re-enter it, they&#039;ll be a few
# minute pause the first time you do
# this. WARNING! If a strange attack occurs
# and the screen gets messed up, HIT
# RESET ( don&#039;t continue playing the game,

# will freeze ! ), DO NOT USE
