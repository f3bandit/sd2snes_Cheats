# June 8th, 2008 On the above date,
# delete this comment, and move acceptable codes
# to an appropriate area. Other people&#039;s versions
# of these codes take precedence for credit
# until my codes are released(in cases of
# similar, but not identical codes, only show
# mine if they use less codes). This
# gives about 6 months for patched games
# to be around before my codes can
# change how they get played.
