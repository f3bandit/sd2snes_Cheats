# in many things... A. If he is
# a zombie or dead-do not revive him
# or the game will freeze. B. Sometimes
# he will a lot of different stuff
# in his stats like: Morph, Capture, Shock,
# Sketch... You should save the game if
# you get something cool   like
# this... C. Kefka in Magitek Armor-same as
# A 3. Mog may freeze the game
# when it is his turn to fight.
# 4. Leo is unglitched-you can revive him
# if he is wounded. (Really preferred if
# he had a screen shot...Kefka uses Terra&#039;s
# screen shot because he doesn&#039;t have one).

#  causes 500 damage.  This spell&#039;s

# by both 			   lightning AND

# If a target is weak against an
# element, the damage   done by
# a spell with that elemental property will
#   be doubled after randomization (see
# below). - If a target has &quot;50%
# Dmg&quot; vs. an element, the damage 
#  done by a spell with that
# elemental property will   be halved
# after randomization. - If a target has
# &quot;No effect&quot; vs. an element, the damage
#   done by a spell with
# that elemental property will   always
# be zero. - If a target has
# &quot;Absorb&quot; on an element, the damage 
#  done by a spell with that
# elemental property will   be added
# to the target&#039;s HP instead of subtracted
#   after randomization. - If a
# target has the &quot;Float&quot; property, all earth-
#   elemental spells will miss. -
# If a target has the &quot;Undead&quot; property,
# all spells   with the &quot;Cure&quot;
# property will cause damage rather  
# than heal.  All spells with the
# &quot;Poison&quot; property   will heal the

# &quot;good end&quot; of a draining spell (i.e.,
# they will    always get
# HP from it; if Drain is cast
# on an undead   creature, the

#   which don&#039;t appear in the
# instruction booklet:   *SEIZURE is like
# Poison, except it only lasts until 
#   the battle is over (if
# untreated).  It can be healed 
#   with the Remedy spell or
# a Remedy item.   *CHARM is
# like Muddle, except it is uncurable. 
# The    only way Charm
# will go away is if PETRIFY or
# WOUNDED    is set over
# it. *FROZEN is like Stop, except it
# lasts longer and can   
# only be healed by targetting the afflicted
# character    with a fire-elemental
# spell.   *HP LEAK is like
# Seizure, except it cannot be cured,

# GG code: D853-5C55
# Substitute ? for 8 or 5 (more
# additions at a future date). These codes
# start the character at a higher experience
# level (thus at a higher level, too).
#  I've used these codes continuously until
# my party reached about level 31 or
# so and have noticed other more subtle
# effects, such as the way the character
# moves in battle, sometimes stumbles in battle,
# etc.  (I at one time, called
# these my 'Personality Codes') They also effect
# the other characters in your party at
# that time--to a limited degree.

# Substitute ? for 8 or 5 (more
# additions at a future date). These codes
# start the character at a higher experience
# level (thus at a higher level, too).
#  I've used these codes continuously until
# my party reached about level 31 or
# so and have noticed other more subtle
# effects, such as the way the character
# moves in battle, sometimes stumbles in battle,
# etc.  (I at one time, called
# these my 'Personality Codes') They also effect
# the other characters in your party at
# that time--to a limited degree.

# effects, such as the way the character
# moves in battle, sometimes stumbles in battle,

# You will find that my codes will

# DO Each piece of armor in the
# game has 32 codes associated with it,
# although  I only have found out
# what 13 do. I am still trying
# to figure out the unknowns. In this
# section, I will explain what each slot
# does, although most slots are self explanatory.
# 1. Who can equip it (#1) &amp;
# Who can equip it (#2) These two
# codes allow you to change who can
# equip each piece of equipment. Putting &#039;EE&#039;
# for both of the codes will allow
# everyone to equip it, as putting &#039;DD&#039;
# for each will allow no one to
# equip it. For variations, see the modifier
# values below. 2. Spell Taught &amp; Spell
# Learn Rate These two codes will allow
# you to give the armor a magic
# spell that you can learn, and the
# learn rate. The learn rate can be
# anything, for magic spells, see the modifier
# value list below. 3. Elemental Attributes: Absorb
# HP, Weak Point, No Effect, 50% Damage
# You can modify the elemental attributes of
# the equipment with these codes. Putting &#039;EE&#039;
# will make all elements effective for that
# code (not all of them show up,
# but they are still in effect). Putting
# &#039;DD&#039; will disable elements. 4. Stat Bonuses:
# Vigor, Stamina, Speed, Mag.Pwr These can range
# from -7 to +7 only, only the
# one letter of each code affect each
# one. So that means Speed and Vigor
# use one code, and Mag.Pwr and Stamina
# use one code. 5. Defense and Magic
# Defense These can be any value from
# 0 to 255. 6. Magic Block and
# Evade These can range from 0% to
# 50% only. Like the stat codes, these
# use only one code.

# Some codes may not work because

# about to read is my PERSONAL OPINION
# and the information that a Galoob Game
# Genie representative has given me.  
#    I have been recieving
# complaints from people about codes not working
#  on their game.  Based on
# my expeience and other sources, I will
# explain  why some codes don&#039;t work
# for your game.    
#  You see, Nintendo sued Galoob many
# years ago, to try to stop 
#  Galoob from creating their Game Genie.
#   Nintendo lost the lawsuit. 
#     Nintendo is actually
# changing the configuration in the game decks
# they are selling.  One batch of
# decks lets you use your present codes.
# The next batch of decks made and
# released are so configured that they will
# not accept the old and proven Game
# Genie codes.  The codes you receive
# are  correct (This came from an
# anonymous informant).     
# Nintendo also changes the configuration of their
# games.  I made this  
# observation after buying another Final Fantasy 3
# game.  I have noticed  that
# there are still codes that won&#039;t work
# for both of them.  Thas led
# me to believe that Nintendo is creating
# different versions of the  games they
# make.  They are doing this to
# either fix the bugs in their games
# and to frustrate Galoob from finding more
# codes.

# Kefka is basically a &quot;Custom&quot; Character, Give
# him Everything you want, Including a face
# that fits. His face is Terra&#039;s, due
# to having no normal face of his
# own, the same goes for the type
# of equipment he can use, which by
# default, is none. Customize your character for
# anything you want, But make at least
# 1 skill type something other than 255,
# &quot;Shock&quot;, &quot;Morph&quot;, &quot;X-Magic&quot;, &quot;Item&quot;, Anything you feel
# like. You may have to redo his
# stats sometimes, like when you have an
# automatically selected group, or when a new
# character is added to the total amount
# of characters.

# After one battle, every member of the
# party who is capable of learning magic
# some time in the game will learn
# every spell. Note that this happens after
# every battle, and it happens regardless of
# whether the party members know the spells
# or not; i.e., turn off the code
# once everyone has learned the spells (unless
# you *like* watching 4 people learn all
# the spells after every battle). An alternative
# code already produced, which works for emulators,
# and only gives spells that character doesn&#039;t
# have.

# Substitute ? for 8 or 5 (more
# additions at a future date). These codes
# start the character at a higher experience
# level (thus at a higher level, too).
#  I've used these codes continuously until
# my party reached about level 31 or
# so and have noticed other more subtle
# effects, such as the way the character
# moves in battle, sometimes stumbles in battle,
# etc.  (I at one time, called
# these my 'Personality Codes') They also effect
# the other characters in your party at
# that time--to a limited degree.

# third letter of the code. HOW TO
# USE THE CODES/WHAT THE SLOTS DO ======================================
# Like the equipment codes, each spell has
# its set of unknowns that I can&#039;t
# figure out. What I have listed below
# is what I have been able to
# figure out. 1.  Damage Type, Usable
# Outside Battle? The first letter of this
# code determines what kind of damage the
# spell will do: Normal damgae - the
# spell will remove HP; MP Damage -
# the spell will remove MP instead of
# HP; no damage - the spell will
# do no damage. The second half will
# determine whether the spell is usable outside
# battle. 2.  Miscellaneous Effect The first
# letter of this code can allow you
# to set the spell so it never
# misses, do damage to a fraction of
# damage of HP, the second half of
# the code can give the spell the
# ability to add status, remove status, and
# other misc. effects. 3.  Elemental Properties
# You can give any spell elemental properties
# with this code. You may give the
# spell multiple elementals, but remember that the
# game will do damage  that the
# enemy is STRONG against. 4.  Power
# This affects how powerful damage/heal spells are.
# Setting this to &#039;DD&#039; will make the
# spell do no damage, and setting it
# to &#039;EE&#039; (maximum) will make the spell
# do maximum damage. You can make the
# Cure spell do 1700 recovery points at
# level 3 with a Mag.Pwr of 39!
# 5.  Special Effect You can vary
# the first two letters of this code
# to make the spell imitate various lore
# spells. A full list is not yet
# available, but I plan to release one
# soon. 6.  Targetting You can change
# the targetting scheme for each spell. You
# can give a spell like Bolt the
# ability to cast on both sides of
# enemies in a pincer attack. Not all
# spells support all types of targetting. For
#  example, &#039;Scan&#039; will only work on
# one enemy regardless of how many targets
# are selected.

# or so and have noticed other more
# subtle effects, such as the way the
# character moves in battle, sometimes stumbles in
# battle, etc.  (I at one time,
# called these my &#039;Personality Codes&#039;) They also
# effect the other characters in your party
# at that time--to a limited degree.

# Substitute ? for 8 or 5 (more

# start the character at a higher experience
# level (thus at a higher level, too).
#  I've used these codes continuously until
# my party reached about level 31 or
# so and have noticed other more subtle
# effects, such as the way the character
# moves in battle, sometimes stumbles in battle,
# etc.  (I at one time, called
# these my 'Personality Codes') They also effect
# the other characters in your party at
# that time--to a limited degree.

# These digits are for use with Storm&#039;s
# Final Fantasy 3 Magic Point Reward 
# codes.  The code that is listed
# next to each index number  works
# for that monster formation that is listed
# only. There are actually  576 total
# monster formations in the game, but you
# can modify only the  first 512,
# but I listed everything past that anyway.
# A lot of the  formations near
# the end I have never seen before,
# but they may be able  to
# be seen by using a Game Genie
# code. Some of the monster formations 
# did not have any enemies, so I
# removed them (these were toward the end,
#  too). INDEX  FORMATION =====

# Substitute ? for 8 or 5 (more

# start the character at a higher experience
# level (thus at a higher level, too).
#  I've used these codes continuously until
# my party reached about level 31 or
# so and have noticed other more subtle
# effects, such as the way the character
# moves in battle, sometimes stumbles in battle,
# etc.  (I at one time, called
# these my 'Personality Codes') They also effect
# the other characters in your party at
# that time--to a limited degree.

# During my studies of the paladin codes,

# half of the items on the list
# (128 of the 256), and these happen

# items on the list.  My studies
# are far from finished however, but so
# far the above code is my result.
#  Add that to the existing codes
# (for a total of 5 codes) and
# the other 128 items (the &#039;even&#039; ones)
# will be called instead of the first
# ones.  Thus, suppose you use a
# checklist, and you exhaust the supply of
# odd items, simply save, restart, and input
# the extra code to finish off your
# list. NOTES: I&#039;ve also noticed that there
# are actually 512 items in the game.
#  Believe it or not, each of
# the 256 items have 2 states: on
# or off.  When an item is
# off, it is still on your item
# list, but the title is invisible, and
# is shuffled to the bottom-the items that
# are on have priority.  Items that
# have a quantity of zero (through glitches)
