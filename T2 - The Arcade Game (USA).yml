# GG code: N/A (WRAM cheat)
# I had intended to modify what secondary
# weapon you have, but it doesn&#039;t seem
# to work that well. It should make
# it so you can choose to always
# have missiles, shotgun, or grenade gun. The
# only effect I noticed was in the
# final battle with the T-1000. When you
# need the Grenade Gun, you&#039;ll have it.
