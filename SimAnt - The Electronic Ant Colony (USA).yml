# This won&#039;t make all black ants win,
# just your yellow ant. A decent strategy
# is to stay directly in the red
# ant entrance to starve the red colony
# early, when there&#039;s only 1 entrance to
# their mound. You&#039;ll have to make your
# own colony self-sufficient for them to starve
# with you surviving. You can also fight
# with the queen directly and win, but
# it can take a little while to
# figure out how to alternate between move
# buttons to get the fight initiated.
