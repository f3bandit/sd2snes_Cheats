# glitchy, must turn off before battle starts,
# while fighters doing their showoff thing. Also
# need to turn off BG3 Layer or
# you can&#039;t see the battle. I&#039;ve only
# had this happen to me vs final
# cell, but if it start with him
# in a white cape he points to
# cell, the does a thumbs down and
# cell whacks him into the backround, like
# in DBZ2.
