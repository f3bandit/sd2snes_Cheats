# This&#039;ll cause you to always have your
# arms up as if carrying a rock.
# The interesting effect is that if you
# use the throw button (without the Always
# have rock code on), and there happens
# to be a rock nearby, you instantly
# have it and throw it. The usefulness
# of this is that, after you have
# the rock near you, you can not
# only use it as a rapid-fire weapon
# by tapping Y, but also that you
# can stand on the rock, and with
# a little practice, use it as an
# air vehicle. It&#039;s kinda cool.
