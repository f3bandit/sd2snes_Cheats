# Note: You must have at least 2
# characters in your party to beat the
# scenario at Mount Drake. It&#039;s also a
# good idea to play a scenario, then
# level up when you want to enable
# the next scenario. You can&#039;t play some
# scenarios if you level up too soon,
# and it&#039;s possible you can avoid all
# of them by leveling quickly, but that
# skips a majority of the storyline, and
# results in a worse ending.
