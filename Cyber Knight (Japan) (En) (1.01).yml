# You get nothing for beating them, and
# they&#039;re invisible, but it&#039;s quick. May not
# give you stuff you could need from
# the enemies. With the &#039;Enable Everything&#039; code,
# you don&#039;t need to get any Neoparts.
# This makes it so you can breeze
# through the game without losing out on
# new equipment because of a lack of
# neoparts. Tested it through a game
