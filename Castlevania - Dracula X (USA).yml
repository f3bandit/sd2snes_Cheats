# I hacked the second code out of
# curiosity a while back. Many of the
# Castlevania games feature a fire whip as
# the normal whip weapon, and it is
# a special attack in this game. I
# wondered if the item crash fire whip
# could be applied to the normal whip.
# Sure enough, there it is. The only
# drawback is that it only works if
# the character is standing on the ground.
# The whip looks normal in the air
# or if you are crouching. Also, you
# cannot use subweapons when this code is
# on, and getting one will glitch the
# graphics. Hence, I recommend the following two
# codes.
