# Press and hold the jump button until
# the desired height is reached. Hit the
# button again to descend. You can still
# use the double jump. (note) 1)Character may
# freeze up when using sword during jump.
# Using a magic spell will unfreeze him,
# (use infinite magic spells code). Conversely, getting
# hit by an enemy will do the
# same. 2) You may have to turn
# off the code before entering some boss
# fighting sequences. You can turn the code
# back on during the fight. The code
# must be turned off before defeating the
# boss for the game to proceed. Note
# 1 applies.
