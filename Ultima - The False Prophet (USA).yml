# At the EE number, it says a

# it actually gives you 0. At the
# 32 number-so far it gives at least
# 43 HP.  I haven&#039;t had time
# to fully test this one,but it does
# hold real promise. I had to start
# a new game ( always looking for
# Starting Stats) so my guys only have
# 90 HP,so at least the 32 number
# actually give you the HP,so it could
# be increased.

# Lord British himself - able to do

# everything!  The downside is, you might
# be in battle all by yourself, as
# sometimes your friends get stuck leaving you
# to walk by yourself. This might be
# useful in a Dungeon - just Save,
# enter this code, heal up, then save
# again, and start again to continue-great way
# to revive without using Foods. You can
# use different slots 1
