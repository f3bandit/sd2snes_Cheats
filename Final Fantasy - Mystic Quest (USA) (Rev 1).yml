# numerical stats like EXP and HP can
# be any number you want. Note that
# they may take one battle to go
# into  effect. The counter attack code
# will inflict a chosen status ailment on
# the enemy when they attack you if
# they are not strong against it. For
# the armor modifier codes, varying what you
# put for the &#039;??&#039; can change what
# you get for armor, putting &#039;DD&#039; will
# start you with no armor. HP can
# be set to any number up to
# 65,535 and it will stay that way!
# Be careful though, because if it goes
# over that, it will start counting over
# from zero if you gain a level...the
# same goes for the other stats if
# they go over 255. OK, one more
# thing...changing the values for the codes marked
# (L) affect the lower byte, which means
# changing this will change from 0-255 only,
# Codes marked with an (M) (EXP codes
# only) and all other  codes marked
# with (H) will change in increments of
# 255, so putting  &#039;DF&#039; would be
# 256 and putting &#039;D4&#039; would be 510,
# and so on... And for EXP codes
# marked with (H) would cause change in

# Most of the codes that modify numerical
# stats like EXP and HP can be
# any number you want. HP can be
# set to any number up to 65,535
# and it  will stay that way!
# Be careful though, because if it goes
# over that,  it will start counting
# over from zero if you gain a
# level...the same  goes for the other
# stats if they go over 255. OK,
# one more thing...changing the values for the
# codes marked (L) affect the lower byte,
# which means changing this will change from
# 0-255 only, Codes marked with an (M)
# (EXP codes only) and all other 
# codes marked with (H) will change in
# increments of 255, so putting  &#039;DF&#039;
# would be 256 and putting &#039;D4&#039; would
# be 510, and so on... And for
# EXP codes marked with (H) would cause
# change in increments of 65,535.
