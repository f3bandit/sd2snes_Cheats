# Gnomes have the fastest and hardest attacks
# of all chars. This code is dangerous
# to experiment with as it can cause
# the game to lock up with the
# only way to unfreeze it being to
# reverse the polarity. I had to remove
# the game from its case and insert
# it backwards to accomplish this. The create
# char screen will not tell you you&#039;re
# creating a Samuri specific character but create
# a [fighter]character and it magically becomes something
# else. A level 1 Gnome will kill
# the laughing kettle instantly.
