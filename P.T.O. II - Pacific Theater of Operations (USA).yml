  Enabled: false
  Code:
  - "C11094FF"
# GG code: EEFB-7FD0
# The first code makes the goals you
# set undone, which in some instances helps
# you (not very often though), in that
# it can reduce the number of cards
# the other people have at the conference
# at the end of each month. This
# code though is only marginally helpful, at
# best.

# GG code: E418-7FD0
# WARNING! DO NOT PLAY WITH THE EFFECT
# SWITCH, IT WILL ERASE YOUR GAME! You
# must have a airfield at whatever base
# before another one is built, if you
# have a base with no airfields this
# code will not build any airfields at
# that base, it will not help you
# then. To use this code, at the
# end of a game month, save it
# at the plan phase, input the code
# (make sure the game effect switch is
# on, turn it on at the input
# code screen, if you do not have
# the effect switch on before you start
# the game you will have problems starting),
# then play the game, after the month
# is over, a screen will tell you
# of the airfields built, wait till a
# screen asking you if you want to
# go to the conference appears, when that
# screen does appear, turn off the effect
# switch, after the conference and when the
# new month starts as soon as possible
# save your game and remove your Game
# Genie from your game.
