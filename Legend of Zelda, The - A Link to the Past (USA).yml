# This requires the code 1D89-0FB3 to allow
# you to walk through walls. Directions are
# for approximately one full screen of scrolling.
# If you move up/down, and left/right, the
# view will eventually settle to the point
# it should be, if it&#039;s not already
# to that point. Waterfall Pond(where you throw
# things in it): From Link&#039;s house, go
# Down(avoid the door), Left, Down. Exit from
# the door in that area to return
# outside your house. Free Green Potions, and
# the Boomerang/Level 2 Shield upgrade can be
# gotten here. Dark World Pond(where you throw
# things in it): Enter from the entrance
# on the Dark World side of Hyrule
# Castle, whether the entrance is opened or
# not.  1/2 Magic Room: Enter the
# cave below the Kakariko Smithy&#039;s hut, and
# go down the stairs. Go Up, Right,
# and you can sprinkle Magic Powder on
# the thing there to halve your magic
# usage. Pond of Happiness: Seems to be
# Up, Left of Fairy Springs(there&#039;s one a
# screen south of Link&#039;s house). Use the
# exit in the Pond of Happiness area
# when you want to leave. Returning to
# the fairy spring can glitch the game,
# and you&#039;ll see a room of fairys
# on the way from the fairy spring,
# if you need them. Cane of Byrna:
# From a Fairy Spring, go Up, Right
# until you change screens, then Left until
# you&#039;re below the treasure chest. You can
# open the treasure chest for the Cane,
# then you can leave by following the
# path over the spikes, without needing any
# protection from them.
