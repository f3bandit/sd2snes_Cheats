# does:  1. You will have the
# Raccoon man.  2. You will swim
# in every level.  3. When you
# get hit by enemies you will keep
# the Raccoon suit. 4. At the end
# of the level you will get a
# mushroom, a star, or a flower card.
# Once you get one card you will
# get the same card until you get
# your lives. ex) 3 stars = 5
# lives
