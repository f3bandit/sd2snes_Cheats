# You will also be invincible.  Includes
# Ugetab's "Invincible" cheats.  Works based on
# bounce, so it is working continually as
# the game registers a hit for bounce
# when walking onto enemies.  Only affects
# enemies hurt by bouncing on them. 
# Excludes turtle boss.  Excludes enemies that
# normally cannot die, or can only be
# stunned.  Disables the "bounce" aspect as
# it was juggling the character into the
# air with multiple enemies, or enemies that
# were invulnerable to bouncing.
