# Both Zero&#039;s and X&#039;s lightsaber weapons (level
# 5) rapid-fire huge energy waves (think of
# how X&#039;s sword normally works, in a
# long stream, that also works for Zero).
# It constantly shoots off in the direction
# that you first used the sword; turning
# around doesn&#039;t move it. The code can
# be turned on and off at will.
# In fact, dialogue will not start until
# you turn the wave off, and you
# MUST NOT use the wave against Mac
# or Doppler. On the plus side, it
# still does 16 damage to any other
# boss, and X can deactivate the wave
# simply by choosing a different weapon from
# the menu (L and R do not
# work while the wave is firing).
