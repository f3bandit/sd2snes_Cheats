  Code:
# I'm not sure what to make of
# this code. At first I thought it
# was a player modifier because they wrestler
# looks different from who you choose, but
# there are glitches galore. The name below
# the energy meter is garbled. The character
# moves extremely fast when walking. So much
# to the point where it's hard to
# properly get your character in position to
# pin your opponent. Also running into the
# ropes can cause your character to get
# stuck. Performing some moves will cause your
# character to move to the bottom of
# the screen, almost as if he's out
# of the ring (but isn't since the
# ref isn't counting). In order to fix
# it, just move as far to the
# upper left or upper right that you
# can & climb the turnbuckle, & you'll
# appear back in the ring.
