# The &#039;XX&#039; in the codes, follow these
# steps:      
# 1. Take your dec number (like 99999
# [don&#039;t go higher than 9999999]) and 
#       
# convert it to hex (01869F)  
#    2. Separate your hex
# number into three sets (01/86/9F)  
#    3. Reverse the order
# of the numbers (9F/86/01)   
#   4. Apply the hex numbers
# to the 3 PAR codes. Example: 
#       
# 7E39269F 7E392786 7E392801 (Hero) The codes that
# end with &#039;__&#039; are not perfected yet,
# and are only my notes.
