# 0x = No invincibility. Not recommended; it
# freezes the game if you run into
# an enemy too many times. 2x =
# Invincibility. Recommended by me; it doesn&#039;t have
# the same problems. You won&#039;t even flash!
# x0 = No item. Unless you want
# a game that might be next to
# impossible to beat and item collections don&#039;t
# affect what you have (with the execption
# of the item to the far right),
# don&#039;t use this. x1 = Have shoes.
# x2 = Have ceiling-sticking hands. x3 =
# Have both shoes and ceiling-sticking hands.
