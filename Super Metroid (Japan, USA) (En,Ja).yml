# <p>These codes use the same method to

# instead of warping to another area, you
# can be  warped to many different
# places in different areas!  Most of
# the time you will load on a
# save point or elevator, but sometimes you
# may appear near a boss lair, etc.
#  With the codes below, I only
# tried possible combinations from when the game
# was last saved from Samus' ship. 
# If the game is saved elsewhere, one
# can warp to different places.  Try
# experimenting with this code.</p>

# DF8A-67A0 change it to:
