# but I haven&#039;t seen any errors caused
# by it. I could go into detail
# explaining this error, but sufficive to say,
# it was a re-initialization error. Feel free
# to add a Jump into some code,
# so you can do both an STA
# #$00, and an STZ $70 in the
# jump, then return. I honestly don&#039;t want
# to do that with a set of
# Game Genie codes.
