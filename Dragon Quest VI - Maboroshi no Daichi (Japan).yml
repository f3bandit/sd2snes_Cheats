# GG code: DD85-EDD6
# As for monsters that rarely offer to
# join, this may increase the odds of
# getting them to join, but it is
# not guaranteed. Important note on these recruitment
# codes: It&#039;s been reported that recruiting a
# 3rd (and final) monster of a given
# type may sometimes recruit an incorrect monster
# or cause other side-effects.  So, you
# may only want to use either (or
# both) of these codes only to recruit
# up to 2 of a given type
# of monster, unless you&#039;re feeling adventurous. 
#    Remember, the normal restrictions
# apply.  Here are the ones I
# know of: You must have at least
# one BeastMaster in your active party in
# order to recruit monsters.  The number
# of active party members in this job,
# as well as their job-level in this
# skill may increase the chances of recruitment.
# There is a limit to the number
# of total party members, including those at
# Luisa&#039;s Place.  After this limit is
# reached, no more monsters may be recruited.
#       
# A maximum of 3 monsters of any
# single kind may be recruited. Also, these
# do not guarantee that more than one
# difficult-to-recruit monster will join.  For instance,
# with these codes, I got the first
# Lamp Demon to join immediately, but subsequent
# battles didn&#039;t yield any additional ones, although
# the possibility may still remain.

# More specifically, any attack that targets the

# enemy) will not work.  One use
# for this is that enemies that use
# attack spells often will waste their MP.
#  Also, you can take advantage of
# the opportunity to cast stat-boosting spells without
# fear of taking damage.  Be sure
# to turn off the code to proceed
# further in battle. This only affects physical
# attacks and attack spells.  Healing and
# status-boosting types of spells will still work
# for both you and for any enemies
# that use them.  The reason for
# this is that these spells typically target
# their own groups (party -&gt; party, enemy
# -&gt; enemy). Fatal-hit attacks, poison-needle style, will
# still work, but only if a hit
# would be fatal.
